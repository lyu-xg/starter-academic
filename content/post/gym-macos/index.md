Itâ€™s simple: install cmake and zlib first, and then install gym and atari environment on macOS.

```[bash]
brew install cmake zlib
pip install 'gym[atari]'
```

The quotation marks are for people who are using zsh.
If you want all environments provided by OpenAI Gym, you can install `gym[all]`.

Enjoy your games.
